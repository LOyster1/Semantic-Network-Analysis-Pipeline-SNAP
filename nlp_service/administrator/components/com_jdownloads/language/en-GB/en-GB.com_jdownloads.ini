However when a user is a member of multiple user-groups it is not possible for jDownloads to <i>unambiguously</i> determine in all circumstances which particular user-group settings should be used. To solve this each set of user-group settings may be given a unique non zero rank value. Please note that the rank is an integer value in the range 0 to 32767, and further to be considered each rank must be a unique non zero value within the entire collection of user-group settings. jDownloads will check the rankings of each user-group for all those user-groups to which the user belongs. Of those the one with the highest ranking value will be selected. During installation rankings for all the primary Joomla user-groups are set to default values. All others are set to zero. Please see the documentation for further notes and examples."
