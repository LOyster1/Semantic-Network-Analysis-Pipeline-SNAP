*CIDLIST is a comma separated list of the ID numbers of those Categories whose Downloads are to be shown, eg 3,12.<br />
count==*N is the maximum number of Downloads to be shown from this category or category list. If count==0 is specified then all Downloads in the category are listed.<br /><br />
<i>Show a Single Download:</i> {jd_file file==*DID}<br /> 
 eg {jd_file file==31} shows the Download with ID of 31  NB this is the style auto entered by the jD Content Button plugin<br /><br />
<i>Show Downloads from a single or several Categories:</i> {jd_file category==*CIDlist count==*N}<br />
 eg {jd_file category==15 count==5} will list upto 5 Downloads from the category whose ID is 15.<br /> 
 eg {jd_file category==15,2 count==0} will list all the Downloads in the categories with IDs 15 and 2.<br />
 eg {jd_file category==15,3,41,6 count==12} will list upto 12 Downloads from those categories with IDs 15, 3, 41 and 6.<br /><br />
<i>Listing latest, top and last updated from any category:</i> {jd_file latest==*N}  {jd_file hottest==*N} {jd_file updated==*N}<br /> 
 eg {jd_file latest==5} lists the 5 latest Downloads.<br />
 eg {jd_file hotest==4} lists the 4 most popular Downloads.<br />
 eg {jd_file updated==5} list the 5 most recently updated Downloads.<br /><br />
<i>Listing latest, top and last updated only from select categories</i><br />
{jd_file cat_hottest==*CID1,*CID2,*CID3 count==*N} eg {jd_file cat_hotest==12,13,3 count==5} lists the 5 most downloaded Downloads from the categories with IDs 12,13 and 3.<br />

<i>Selecting layouts</i><br />
{jd_file onlinelayout==layout name} you can use this to select the which layout to use when showing Downloads.<br />
That is it is possible to use specific layouts rather than the layout selected in the Configuration - Plugin tab.<br />
Example: {jd_file onlinelayout==Simple File List}{jd_file latest==5 count==3}"
